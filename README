ZED TEXTURE TOOL

README

OVERVIEW

The ZED Texture Tool is intended to create compact textures with metadata ready
for use by the ZED library.  Image data is imported into the tool (PNG,TGA,JPG)
which can be used to add to a cubemap face, 3D texture layer, as part of a
texture atlas, etc. with the option of generating mip maps and different
compression schemes.
